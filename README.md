Updated NestedVM toolchain
==========================

This repository contains an updated [NestedVM][1] toolchain that is suitable
for building modern C/C++ applications to pure Java bytecode.  The official
NestedVM project hosted at [nestedvm.ibex.org][1] only supports an old version
of GCC (3.3.6).  Fortunately, [Henry Wertz][2] has made available to use GCC 
4.8 and an updated newlib, and this repository includes those patches.

This repo also has some bug fixes by [David Ehrmann][3] to NestedVM's 
`UnixRuntime` and the parsing of ELF files generated by GCC 4.8.

Also incorporated in this repo are [John Stroy's][4] updates to
the NestedVM runtime.

Below are some system-specific build instructions for this repository; pull
requests with steps for other environments are certainly welcome.
